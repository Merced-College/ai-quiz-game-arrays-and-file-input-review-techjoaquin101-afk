# ArrayReviewWithJava

# AI Quiz Game — Arrays and File Input Review

## Overview

This assignment is designed to review:

* Java programming
* Arrays
* Two-dimensional arrays
* File input using CSV files
* Loops
* Comments and code readability
* GitHub Classroom and Codespaces

The program reads quiz questions and answer choices from a CSV file and stores them into arrays. The user then plays an AI-themed quiz game in the console.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, students will:

* Practice working with arrays and parallel data structures
* Read data from a file into arrays
* Use loops to process data
* Improve code readability with comments
* Work with GitHub Classroom and Codespaces
* Create a visual representation of program data structures

## Files Included

| File                    | Description                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `AIQuizGame.java`       | Main Java program                              |
| `ai_quiz_questions.csv` | CSV file containing quiz questions and answers |
| `README.md`             | Assignment instructions                        |

---

# Instructions

## Step 1: Open the Repository in Codespaces

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment link.
2. Open the repository.
3. Click the green **Code** button.
4. Open the project in **Codespaces**.

---

## Step 2: Run the Program

Compile and run the program.

The program should:

* Read the CSV file
* Store the data into arrays
* Display quiz questions
* Let the user answer questions
* Display the final score

---

## Step 3: Add Required Header Comments

At the top of the Java file, add:

```java
/*
Name:
Date:
Program Description:
*/
```

Describe what the program does.

---

## Step 4: Add Comments Throughout the Code

Add at least **20 meaningful comments** explaining the purpose of the code.

Good comments explain *why* or *what* the code is doing.

Example:

```java
// This loop displays all answer choices for the current question.
```

---

## Step 5: Add an Enhancement

Add at least **5 new lines of code** to improve the program.

Examples:

* Add more questions
* Display a percentage score
* Add replay functionality
* Add score messages
* Add input validation

Clearly comment where your enhancement begins.

Example:

```java
// Enhancement: Displays a message based on the player's score.
```

---

## Step 6: Create a Data Structure Visual

Create a visual diagram showing the data structures used in the program.

Your diagram should include:

* The `questions` array
* The `answers` two-dimensional array
* Array names
* Index values
* Example stored values
* How the indexes connect between the arrays

You may:

* Draw digitally
* Draw by hand and scan/photo it

Save the file as something similar to:

* `array_diagram.png`
* `array_diagram.jpg`
* `array_diagram.pdf`

Upload the file to the repository or submit it in Canvas.

---

## Submission Requirements

Submit:

* Updated Java source code
* Completed enhancement
* Data structure visual
* GitHub repository link

---

## Reminder

Commit and push your work regularly to GitHub.
